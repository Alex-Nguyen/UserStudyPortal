Discovery of communities and patterns that govern their evolution plays an important role in social network. Scientists are transitioning from static to dynamic models that incorporate time, and emphasize the importance of the temporal ordering of interactions.  While many tools have been developed to visualize communities in static social networks, the problem remains largely unresolved in dynamic networks.

In this video, we introduce Time Radar, a visualization tool for visualizing the dynamic of multivariate communities via timeline representations.

The main interface of TimeRadar chart  consists of multiple timelines stacked vertically. The timeline axis is aligned horizontally from left to right. Each sequence of events is represented as a straight line. Unconnected timeline (or white space in between) indicates that there is missing data at that time period. Radar chart is superimposed as a glyph onto the timeline event with the center of the radar being at the position of the date associated with the events, indicating that there is an interesting change in community formation. This change is also identified  by the change of color on the timeline where each color is represented by a community. The main advantage of this approach is that users are able to detect change of a single temporal data while it is difficult to see dynamic community behavior

Another approach to reveal these changes is to use time bundling technique where timelines in the same community are bundled or grouped closer to each other in the spatial space. The advantage of this method is that the analyst can easily identify similar event.
